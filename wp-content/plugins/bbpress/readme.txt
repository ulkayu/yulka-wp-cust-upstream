bbPress is forum software for WordPress.

== Description ==

Are you looking for a timeless, elegant, and streamlined discussion board? bbPress is easy to integrate, easy to use, and is built to scale with your growing community.

bbPress is intentionally simple yet infinitely powerful forum software, built by contributors to WordPress.

== Installation ==

= From your WordPress dashboard =

1. Visit 'Plugins > Add New'
2. Search for 'bbPress'
3. Activate bbPress from your Plugins page. (You will be greeted with a Welcome page.)

= From WordPress.org =

1. Download bbPress.
2. Upload the 'bbpress' directory to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory, using your favorite method (ftp, sftp, scp, etc...)
3. Activate bbPress from your Plugins page. (You will be greeted with a Welcome page.)

= Once Activated =

1. Visit 'Forums > Add New' and create some forums. (You can always delete these later.)
2. If you have pretty permalinks enabled, visit example.com/forums/, or if you do not have pretty permalinks enabled, visit example.com?post_type=forum
3. Visit 'Settings > Forums' and configure the settings to best match the needs of your community.
4. Visit 'Tools > Forums > Import Forums' if you have an existing forum to convert to bbPress.

= Once Configured =

* bbPress comes with a robust theme-compatibility API that does its best to make bbPress look and feel right with just-about any WordPress theme. You may need to adjust some styling on your own to make everything look pristine.
* You may want to customize the register/activation/sign-in/lost-password flows, to better suit your site. bbPress comes with a bevy of shortcodes to make this possible, listed here: https://codex.bbpress.org/shortcodes/
* bbPress also comes with built-in support for Akismet and BuddyPress, two very popular and very powerful WordPress plugins. If you're using either, visit your Forum Settings page and ensure that integration appears correct.
